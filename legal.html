            <p>Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a <a href="http://googleusercontent.com/creativecommons.org/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)</a>.</p>

            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>Cookies are files with small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive. Like many sites, I use "cookies" to collect information. You can decline or consent to the useage of cookies for this site as well as you can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Site.</p>
            
            <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
            <p>The website use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC ("Google"), after your consent to the cookie policy and based on the legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of my website within the meaning of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the online offer by the user is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
            <p>Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law (<a href="http://googleusercontent.com/www.privacyshield.gov/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Activ</a>).</p>
            <p>Google will use this information on my behalf to evaluate the use of the website by users, to compile reports on the activities within this website and to provide me with other services related to the use of this website. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created from the processed data.</p>
            <p>I only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization (IP-masking). This means that the IP address of the user is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. The full IP address is only transferred to a Google server in the USA and abbreviated there in exceptional cases.</p>
            <p>The IP address transmitted by the user's browser is not merged with other Google data. The users can prevent the storage of cookies by setting their browser settings accordingly. Users can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to their use of the online offer and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: <a href="http://googleusercontent.com/tools.google.com/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>.</p>
            <p>Further information on the use of data by Google, setting and objection options can be found in Google's data protection declaration (<a href="http://googleusercontent.com/policies.google.com/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>) and in the settings for the display of advertisements by Google (<a href="http://googleusercontent.com/adssettings.google.com/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated</a>).</p>
            <p>The personal data of the users will be deleted or anonymized after 14 months.</p>

            <h3>Revocation of Consent</h3>
            <p>It is likely that you consented to the cookie policy when you opened the website. You may withdraw your consent at any time by deleting the cookies in your browser.</p>

            <h3>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 1, 2025 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.</p>

            <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
            <p>This website contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents I have no influence. Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal infringements at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, it is unreasonable to expect a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If I become aware of any legal infringements, I will remove such links immediately.</p>
